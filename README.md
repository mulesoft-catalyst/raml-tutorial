This asset provides a basic idea about how to use the reusable RAML fragments(https://github.com/mulesoft-catalyst/reusable-raml-fragments) in a RAML specification project. This asset contains sample project which uses the resuable RAML fragments and demostrates best practices when designing a RAML specfications.

## Usage Instructions

1. Publish the reusable RAML fragments into exchange.
2. Add all the contents of this repository into a ZIP excluding the license and readme.md file.
3. Go to your Design Centre Project and choose "Import", then select the ZIP.
4. Ensure you set the root RAML as the one which has been imported.
5. Update the resusable RAML fragment dependency and update the reference of the dependencies accordingly.
7. This asset can now be modified into any new API Specification in Design Centre project.
